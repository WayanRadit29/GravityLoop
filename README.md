# 🌌 Gravity Loop

**Developed by:**  
- Wayan
- Belva

## 🧩 Project Overview
**Gravity Loop** is a 2D physics-based space game where the player controls a glowing energy orb influenced by planetary gravity.  
Players must enter planetary orbits, time their release precisely, and travel from one planet to another while avoiding obstacles such as meteors, black holes, and AI-driven Meteor Drones.

This project is built using **Python** and **Pygame**, applying **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles to ensure clean, modular, and scalable game architecture.

## 🚀 Features (Planned)
- Gravitational swing mechanics between planets  
- Physics-based movement and orbit simulation  
- Static obstacles (meteors) and dynamic obstacles (Meteor Drones)  
- Black hole gravity hazard  
- Adaptive AI difficulty system  
- Portal objective to complete levels  
- Minimalistic space-themed visuals  
- Simple one-button control scheme  
- Optional sound effects and background music  

---

## 🧠 Learning Objectives
- Implement OOP concepts (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction) in game development  
- Build a physics-influenced movement system using Pygame  
- Implement basic AI for dynamic obstacles  
- Practice team collaboration through Git and GitHub  
- Develop a complete game prototype from concept to presentation

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3  
- **Library:** Pygame  
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub, VS Code
