# 🎮 SwingBound

**Developed by:**  
- Belva
- Wayan

## 🧩 Project Overview
**SwingBound** is a physics-based 2D platformer game inspired by *SWINGO*.  
The player controls a character who cannot walk or jump, but instead swings around using a grappling rope to navigate through platforms and reach the goal.
This project is developed using **Python** and **Pygame**, applying the principles of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** for clean and modular game architecture.

## 🚀 Features (Planned)
- Smooth swinging physics using rope mechanics  
- Gravity and collision handling  
- Multiple platforms and obstacles  
- Simple scoring or timer system  
- Restart and level progression  
- (Optional) Background music and visual effects  


## 🧠 Learning Objectives
This project is part of our **Object-Oriented Game Development** case study.  
Our main goals are to:
- Understand OOP concepts in game design  
- Implement physics and event handling using Pygame  
- Collaborate effectively in a version-controlled environment (GitHub)


## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3  
- **Library:** Pygame  
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub, VS Code
